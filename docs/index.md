  <b>The new home for all your photos.</b>
</p>

## Home screen
The home screen shows a random favourite or just any random photo of no images have been marked as favourites.

## Image stream
All images, irrespective of album, are shown based on their date in descending order

## Albums
The albums correspond to your folder structure in your image collection. In this example, albums/folders have been created based on the date they were taken on. Frickl will display them in that exact structure without you having to do anything.

## Favourites
Images can be marked as favourites and will be shown on a dedicated page so that they are easily accessible.

## Tags
Any number of tags can be assigned to individual images or all images within a folder. There is no automatic image tagging based on machine learning, but it's still an incredibly useful mechanism. Image tags are also stored within the images themselves, so they can be used outside of Frickl.

## Map
The map shows geotagged images around the globe to highlight all the places you've been to.

## Calendar
Want to know when you tend to take the most photos? The calendar shows you a heatmapped calendar view based on the number of images taken each day. Clicking on a day shows all photos from this day.

## Statistics
There's also a wee page with some statistics across all your photos. This page is going to be expanded on in the near future.
